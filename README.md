## Design and Site structure

The site mirrors what an african eatery would look like in the United Kingdom or Europe to give diaspora africans a taste of home.
The main page is as viewed below.

## Features

### Navbar

Due to the base extension, the navigation bar is present on all pages of the site. If the user is logged in, the right end of the navbar changes from "Welcome, AnonymousUser to welcome, John(depending on the name of the user)". The navbar also collapses into a hamburger icon for smaller screen sizes.

Navigation bar for user's without an account.

![Navigation bar for unauthorised user's](staticfiles/images/readme-images/nav-bar2.png)

Navigation bar for logged in users.
![Authenticated user's Navigation](staticfiles/images/readme-images/nav-bar1.png)

### Home page

On the Home page, unauthorised users cannot see my bookings and book now links on the nav bar . 
![Home page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/home-page.png)

### Sign up page

This page allows unauthorised users to create an account by following the instructions.
![Sign up page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/sign-up.png)


### Login page

This page allows user's with account to login by providing their credentials.

![Sign in page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/sign-in.png)


### Menu page

The menu button on the navbar when clicked, takes the user to the menu page which provides users with available menu and the corresponding price to choose from.
![Menu page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/menu-page.png)


### Book now page

The Book now nav link when clicked, takes the user to the book now page. For logged in user's, a table to fill to make bookings shows up.

#### Book Now page for a logged in user

![Book Now page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/book-now-page.png)

### My Bookings page

The my bookings page displays bookings made by the logged in user, with details about the bookings.If there is no booking yet, the logged in user is told with a further suggestion to make bookings with a provided link to the page to make bookings.

![Booking page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/my-bookings-page.png)


### Edit booking page

Every bookings made by a logged in user can be modified by either editing the bookings or deleting them. The modify and delete button exist on my bookings page.

![Edit booking page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/edit-booking.png)

### Double booking prevention

When a user makes a booking that already exits, the server renders the 500.html file in the templates folder, telling the user that the booking exists. 
![Double booking prevention](staticfiles/images/readme-images/double-booking-page.png)


### Delete button

Only a logged in user has access to this feature. Once this button is clicked the JavaScript code renders a modal to further get assurance that the user wants to delete that booking before deletion is done.

![Delete booking page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/delete-booking.png)


### Logout page

A logged in user can log out by clicking the logout button on the navbar. This action takes the user to the sign out page to get confirmation before the user is logged out.

![Logout page](staticfiles/images/readme-images/log-out.png)


### Responsive design

The site was designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile use.
This project has been tested using the Google Chrome Developer multi-device emulator with different screen sizes.

## Testing

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- The booking form was not rendering. This was fixed after I installed Django crispy forms
- The use of modal via JavaScript to delete booking was not working. I used the wrong url to trigger the delete action. I fixed 
  this by replacing urls pattern = [ path('delete_booking/<int:booking_id>/', views.booking_delete,name='booking_delete'),] with 
  urls pattern = [ path('bookings/delete_booking/<int:booking_id>/', views.booking_delete,name='booking_delete'),]

#### Unresolved Bugs

- The code does not look broken, I don't know why there is validator error.
 ![signup page W3C  code testing](staticfiles/images/readme-images/unfixed-bug.png)

- There is an uncaught type error in the console of developer tools, however, it does not affect the site in any way.
 ![Uncaught type error](staticfiles/images/readme-images/uncaught-type-error.png)

## Validation

### HTML Validation:

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. 
Errors was noticed when carrying out HTML validation for the sign up page. Since it's a generated form from CI codestar blog project, there is no access to the form to do the neccessary modification of the code.
